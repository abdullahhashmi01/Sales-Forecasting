🛒 Walmart Sales Forecasting

This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting sales for Walmart stores using historical data.

📘 Overview

The goal of this project is to predict future sales, understand store-level performance, and uncover seasonal patterns that influence weekly sales.

🧰 Tech Stack

Python

Pandas | NumPy

Seaborn | Matplotlib

Statsmodels (for time series decomposition)

⚙️ Project Workflow

Data Cleaning

Handled missing and duplicate values

Removed outliers using IQR method

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized store-wise and top 10 performing stores

Analyzed weekly sales trends

Feature Engineering

Created quarterly and temperature-based categories

Time Series Analysis

Used seasonal_decompose for trend, seasonality, and residual analysis

📈 Key Insights

Top-performing stores contribute significantly to overall sales
